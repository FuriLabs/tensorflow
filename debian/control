Description: Computation using data flow graphs for scalable machine learning (shared library)
 TensorFlow is an open source software library for numerical computation
 using data flow graphs. The graph nodes represent mathematical operations,
 while the graph edges represent the multidimensional data arrays (tensors)
 that flow between them. This flexible architecture enables you to deploy
 computation to one or more CPUs or GPUs in a desktop, server, or mobile
 device without rewriting code.
 .
 This package provides the shared library.
